Mini casino game I'm working on in C#/WPF

All games are working and playable, and no major bugs present themselves. However, there are a few features still missing:


ALL: Help/rules/scoring screens. Things like payouts for slots and video poker.

ALL: Tidying up the interface. Right now it's only the bare bones of a working interface - but of course, the important thing is that every game is working.

BLACKJACK: Currently splitting is unavailable.

SLOTS: Bonus game, normally triggered by 3 hadoukens, isn't complete yet. Instead it just pays out 5*bet.

VIDEO POKER: Complete! In terms of game play, that is.

ROULETTE: Only some bets are available. Custom bets - like corners to bet 4 numbers at a time, are unavailable. Technically this isn't a problem, as any such bet can be replicated just by betting each number it relates to. But it makes sizing occasionally awkward.
